        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You’ll be so glad to have this little recipe in your back pocket because it’s so useful and versatile.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You start with a roux made by melting the butter in a small pot and whisking in the flour until you get a lightly golden paste. Cooking the flour with butter first cooks the raw flour taste out of the mixture.</li>
            <li>Then slowly pour in the milk, being careful to whisk out any lumps as they form, and stir until you have a nice bubbly, creamy sauce.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce is thickened, turn off the heat and stir in the cheese a handful at a time. Add salt, pepper, and optional cayenne to taste, and voilà. Perfect cheese sauce ready to tasty up whatever you’re going to pour it over.</li>
        </ol>
